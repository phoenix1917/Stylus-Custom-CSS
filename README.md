## Stylus-Custom-CSS

Custom css used in [Stylus Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo?hl=zh-CN). Some of the style sheets are modified based on [UserStylus Archive](https://33kk.github.io/uso-archive/?search=).

FYI: Websites updates frequently, these styles may not be useful when you see them. These are pure css and most of the `.classNames` or `#ids` are hard-coded for convenience. You can let me know if certain css is out-dated.
